13. Conclusion and Recommendations
The technical architecture outlined in this document provides a comprehensive foundation for building the Incenta Employee Advocacy App. By following modern cloud-native practices and a microservices approach, the application will be scalable, secure, and maintainable.
Key Recommendations:

Start with MVP Features: Focus on core case management, document handling, and basic chat to deliver value quickly
Security-First Approach: Implement security controls from the beginning due to PHI/PII requirements
Establish DevOps Early: Set up CI/CD and monitoring before development begins
Cross-Functional Teams: Organize teams around business capabilities rather than technical layers
Performance Benchmarks: Establish performance requirements and test regularly

By implementing this architecture, Incenta will have a robust platform that meets the needs of both employees seeking assistance and advocacy specialists providing support, while maintaining compliance with healthcare industry regulations.
